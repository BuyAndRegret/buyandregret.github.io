                    <h2 class="">Battlefield 1 first impressions -Trgrf</h2>
                    <p>Battlefield 1 a game with so much at stake for the developers known as DICE. June 12, 2016 was the first
                        day the world finally got to see the gameplay of Battlefield 1 the next step in line for the Battlefield
                        series and I like many others watched in anticipation to see what the game had in store for us. Battlefield
                        1 needed to make a showing in order to not be seen in the same light as its predecessor Battlefield
                        Hardline and to say the least the game has done so in a very spectacular fashion. From the moment
                        the gameplay started I was glued to my computer screen watching as the two different armies fought
                        one another in such mind blowing combat. The game as a whole was very impressive and the only thing
                        that could been better was if I was able to take part in the gameplay, but it was not only one thing
                        that stood out among the rest of the game it was everything that I had the chance to see.</p>
                        <p> To
                        start it off from the moment you see the gameplay it is easy to tell how well refined the graphics
                        are and how they bring the game to life better than any previous Battlefield. The new Frostbite engine
                        is the reason behind the great advancement in the beauty of the game's graphics. The game really
                        shows off the tragic and merciless time that we know as World War 1 in a whole new light and I mean
                        that literally the game is very vibrant in color. To say the least Battlefield 1 is looking better
                        than ever compared to it’s predecessors but this does not mean that I am referring only to it’s visuals.</p>

                        <p>I was a very hardcore Battlefield Bad Company 2 and Battlefield 3 player so much so I would return
                        home from school day after day and spend hour after hour playing those games and trying to improve
                        my skills. Battlefield 3 is where I finally felt my time paying off from the hours of gameplay combined
                        with the hours of watching gameplay to learn new tricks to improve my own play style and gameplay.
                        I was not however a fan of Battlefield 4, due to the change in gameplay that I noticed while playing
                        the game, it felt as though the game was going down the path of a more fast paced shooter than the
                        usual slower paced and more strategy heavy Bad Company and Battlefield 3 that I knew and loved. While
                        watching the gameplay of Battlefield 1 I could see the gameplay that I have been longing for, a game
                        that is going to bring back the slower paced strategic gunplay that makes a Battlefield what it really
                        is a strategic shooter. During the gameplay broadcast I saw a few things that peaked my interest
                        in terms of the game's mechanics to just basic game changes. One of which was that it was very apparent
                        that the weapons within Battlefield 1 really reassume the real life thing all guns in the game have
                        their own recoil patterns which will add so much more to gun on gun fights that are so frequent in
                        shooters. Instead of it being a game that whoever shoots first wins, it will turn into a game where
                        whoever compensates for a weapons recoil and the characters body movement will have more of an advantage
                        in combat. A melee system was added to the game where you can customize your melee weapon to one
                        of your choosing so instead of a man with a knife drawn running after you he could have a machete
                        or even the newly integrated bayonet. The bayonet is what some would call a double edged sword since
                        you are very vulnerable while charging which is the only way to use the weapon but at the same time
                        if you land a hit you are guaranteed a kill. Another bonus of the Battlefield franchise is the level
                        destruction in which everything is your playground to blow up, destroy or in this instance create
                        cover. Battlefield 1 brings in the concept of player created cover by using explosives or even vehicles
                        to give you an advantage in combat whether it be blowing up some ground in order to fall in a hole
                        to use as cover or even using your tanks to simultaneously break a wall and use it to your advantage.
                        Finally from what I have seen the squad size in Battlefield 1 has been reverted back to 4 man squads
                        whether this is going to be normal in the game has yet to be seen but all in all not a major issue
                        unless you have 4 friends wanting to play all at once which my advice to you is stop being so popular.</p>
                        
                        <p>In many games developers have added weather systems to enhance gameplay whether it be for better
                        or for worse. And now the same can be said for Battlefield 1 in which the games day through night
                        and even whether it rains or just gets foggy is all randomly determined before you get into a match.
                        The beauty of this is how well it works everyone knows the struggle of upping your brightness if
                        a nighttime cycle gets too dark for you to shoot the enemy but what about weather conditions that
                        are not so easy to deal with. The rain feature within Battlefield 1 is very dynamic to the point
                        of you see the rain droplets land on your gun and disperse. Which really impacts close ranged gun
                        fights. The really beautiful weather change in Battlefield 1 however is the fog effect that appears
                        randomly during a match and inhibits all line of sight making those pesky snipers move from their
                        comfy ledges. The fog deeply impacts the gameplay making even the closest of gunfights a shot in
                        the dark. It is safe to say the new additions in Battlefield 1 are not to be overlooked. </p>
                        <p>My
                        first impression of Battlefield 1 to put it simply is very promising and definitely on my list of
                        games to buy. From the new weather system to just the basic gameplay it feels like a breathe of fresh
                        air for the Battlefield franchise and it gives me hope for having my favorite shooter back. Only
                        time will tell as more and more gameplay and trailers are released for the game but I keep my hopes
                        high that the game is as amazing and as promising as it looks. I hope you enjoyed my first impressions
                        on Battlefield 1 and I look forward to all the feedback that is yet to come. </p>
