                    <h1>Doom (Xbox One) Review -R3c0n31</h1>
                    <h2>Single Player</h2>
                            <p>Doom is an iconic game in video gaming as a whole and I’m proud to say that it does everything right to

                            live up to its legacy. Not only does this reboot do justice to its name, but it invigorated the FPS shooter

                            genre for me. People are comparing this game to Call of Duty, and Halo but this game is far from close to

                            either of those games. Doom is fast paced, responsive, and it just feels “good” to play. Every demon

                            room is harder than the next, involving new demons in your sights, giving you new challenges such as

                            the Hell Knights that chase you down trying to pummel you with its fists, or the summoner that attacks

                            you from long range summoning even more demons forcing you to battle more and more demons till

                            you reach her. Doom is fast paced, on the hardest difficulty, if you stop you die because every demon in

                            the room has the ability to kill you. I played the game on the nightmare difficulty and never have I felt so

                            satisfied with a hard game. The game itself feels that you can complete it, it never feels impossible no

                            matter how many time you die, no how many times to reload your save, it always feels possible to keep

                            going. There is a harder difficulty called ultra-nightmare but if you die on that difficulty your campaign is

                            over, there is no respawning, there is no reloading, and you die the game ends. I am not good enough as

                            at this game to attempt it. The story of the game is probably the weakest of the entirety of the game but

                            it is not bad, but there are just to many questions that are left unanswered about the background of the

                            world of DOOM but it did not alter my love of this game for the characters that are in the game are

                            strong from their voice actors, or in the case Doom Guy, the lack of. Lastly the graphics, the graphics are

                            amazing. The ID Tech 6 engine is probably the best looking engine I’ve seen on console to date. If you

                            love graphics and enjoy the very little detail, you would not be disappointed, and PC on ultra-settings is

                            breathtaking. This game has gameplay and graphics to the max of potential for this first attempt at

                            reviving the DOOM franchise, story could be better but it still does not disappoint for Doom is not

                            known for the story but it’s a welcome addition. This game is amazing, and I am happy that it does

                            justice for a reboot and its legacy to the original. If you have $65 than go buy this game for you will be

                            getting your money’s worth and even more. <br>
                                                      </p>
                          <h2>Multiplayer</h2>
                          <p>Let me first say that Dooms multiplayer is not Call of duty and it is not Halo, it is Doom. Dooms

                    multiplayer is fast paced, twitch shooting for everything kills and the faster you faster the easier it is to

                    win a gun fight. It’s unlockable feel better to get than other games cause most of the time it feels

                    guaranteed to get something instead of relying only on RNG for that something to drop. You always feel

                    like you’re getting something for your work I the game no matter how hard you may lose or how easy it

                    is to win, you feel good playing. In the term of salt buildup from the multiplayer, there very little to none

                    for me personally, I never felt like I wanted to throw my controller, I never felt bad being killed by 4

                    people at once, I always felt calm in situations for I knew if I was going to go down, I would try my

                    hardest to take someone with me. The multiplayer could be better but with the addition of Snap Map

                    the content is basically endless as more people of the community create more maps, more level for the

                    campaign, or just something different such as being a raccoon mother and taking care of your demon

                    children as you dig in the trash for food. Yes that is a possibility. While its multiplayer is not strong, it is

                    also not disappointing.</p>
