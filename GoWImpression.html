                        <h2 class="" >Gears of War 4 Impressions -Trgrf</h2>
                    <p>Gears of War 4 the next big name in the Gears of War series has been announced and with it comes high expectations along with so many questions involving what road the developers Epic Games will lead the franchise to in the future. The Gears of War franchise has given so much to its player base from a heart stopped campaign filled with action and drama to an addictive multiplayer that brought many players in and kept them there for years. Whether or not Gears of War 4 will have the same effect is yet to be seen, due to the eight minute long gameplay trailer shown at E3. However if anything is to be known the Gears of War trilogy is that Epic Games has not yet disappointed their fans expect for that whole judgement joke that was going around for about a year but that is behind us now. What Gears of War 4 will bring to the table is the question on many gamers minds that follow the game, and from the trailer all that can be told is a new form of locust or even a new enemy all together. I can not point out exactly what will be held within the game but I can tell you what I hope it will hold within.</p>
                    <p>When I think about a Gears of War game I focus on the campaign that comes with it, I have been a huge Gears of War 2 fan since the it released on November 7th of 2008. I know that may seem odd to some why start out in the middle of a trilogy well that was when I first got an Xbox 360 but donâ€™t you worry I later picked up Gear of War 1 and played through it and boy was it an experience. I played all the Gears of War titles on insane and beat every single one of them multiple times and it was totally worth the time I spent doing so and that is what I plan to do with Gears of War 4. To put it simply I am in love with all of Gears of War campaigns since they are incredibly fun and challenging even with a friend and I hope Gears of War 4 brings the same type of fun with its campaign. </p>
                    <p>I was never really into the multiplayer that came with Gears of War it just never appealed to me but that said it is not because the gameplay within it was bad. Gears takes a lot of fast paced movement and shooting being at the top of your game really helps with the fast paced combat. If you are into the multiplayer that Gears of War brings than I hope that it is just what you are looking for when the game releases. I don't have much else to say about the multiplayer in Gears other than it is fun and competitive while at the same time being worth the money you pay for. </p>
                    <p>Gears of War 4 has a lot of expectations for all Gears of War fans out there myself included and we all hope for its success. If you are on the fence about buying the game all I have to tell you is wait for a bit more coverage before spending your money as for me I will definitely be buying it and playing the campaign for endless hours until I complete it on insane. I hope you enjoyed my first impressions on Gears of War 4 and I look forward to all the feedback. Have a nice day everyone. </p>
