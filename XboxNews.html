                    <h2>Xbox Conference news roundup</h2>
                    <P>Another wonderful year at E3 passes us by revealing a huge selection of games

and other major news coming from Sony, Microsoft, Bethesda, and Ubisoft. Let&#39;s start

this all by going through the major news from the Xbox One scene such as games,

console upgrades, and controller upgrades. Microsoft started off their E3 conference by

announcing the Xbox One S a new console that is 40% smaller than the model everyone

has today the release date for the new Xbox One S is sometime in August. Microsoft has

given us a teaser for Project Scorpio a new adaptation of the xbox one console which is in

development and has a release around Christmas 2017. The new Xbox Play Anywhere

service is great if you digitally buy a game on the Xbox One that same game can be

played on Windows 10 at no additional cost, cross platform gaming in other words.</P>
                    <p>The amount of wonderful games that were announced at this year&#39;s E3 was

more than just a shock to all of us here at BuyandRegret we are super excited to inform

you on all the big name titles presented. Gears of War 4 is finally upon us with its

extraordinary 8 minute gameplay shown at E3 I can safely say it&#39;s one of the top 3

anticipated games coming out, it&#39;s release date is on October 11, 2016. After 4 years of

waiting Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon Wildlands is said to be released on March 7, 2017.

We here at BuyandRegret are extremely excited for Battlefield 1 after seeing the

multiplayer gameplay we are looking forward to getting our hands on it, it&#39;s said to be

release on October 21, 2016. The stealth and cunning of Dishonored is back with

Dishonored 2 said to be released on November 11, 2016. For Honor has been on our hit

list for quite some time we see it as Chivalry Medieval Warfare on steroids with a new hit

target system that brings the game to a whole knew world of possibilities, the game is

said to be released by February 14, 2017. The gangsters are back after 6 years of hiding

Mafia 3 is almost here said to be released on October 7, 2016. Titanfall 2 if it lives up to

its predecessor we could be looking at the future of FPS said to be released sometime in

December of this year. We’ve all seen the trailer for Watch Dogs 2 it looks great but the

first Watch Dogs gave off the same feeling of how great it was going to be but ended up

being a let down so far it looks good hope to see more soon, Watch Dogs 2 will be

released on November 15, 2016. Thanks for reading and this has been PsychoticOdious

with the news.</p>
