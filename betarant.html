                <h1>Why are betas the new demos?</h1>
                <p>
                    <rant start>
                </p>
                <p> Whatever happened to the days where you could download a demo of the game you wanted to buy? It used to be
                    efficient to figure out whereas you like the game and buy it, or if you skip it. Actually, it was too
                    efficient to be honest. A demo was basically saying that that is the game you were gonna get, and no
                    big changes were going to be made to the game. If there was only a word to say that the game is done
                    but it could still change in the future... Oh wait… there is…</p>

                <h2> Why are beta’s stupid </h2>
                <p>A beta is the second phase of the development period where you have a mostly working game with bug errors,
                    but it is mostly working. The next step after a beta is a Release Candidate(RC) and then a Release to
                    Manufacturers(RTM). The problem with releasing betas for gamers to figure out the bug fixes is that gamers
                    are too whiny. Gamers find a way to break the most perfect game into pieces for literary no reason. Evolve
                    and Overwatch have almost the same length and content, but Evolve was burned to the ground because of
                    micro transactions even though Overwatch also had them(and at least evolve let you know what you're gonna
                    get, not the RNG bullshit). So what gives? Why did one game failed and another one didnt? Because gamers
                    like to suck Blizzard’s dick so it takes a pass, and Evolve closes its doors to a pretty promising IA.
                    The problem is that gamers are unpredictable, and you never know what they’ll ike or not, and leaving
                    the QA testing to a bunch of 12-25 years old will only result on “request” to make the game better, but
                    the problem is that some request are just too demanding. Seriously, go to reddit’s subreddit for Destiny,
                    Halo, or The Division and you will know what I mean.</p>

                <h2>Why are “stress” test stupid</h2>
                <p>The other problem is that they do “stress” test to hide the fact that the game is finished and they just
                    want to tease you to buy it, while still promising that if you didn't like it the game might change in
                    the future based on future feedback provided by you. The problem? Stress test are dumb and here is why:
                    stress test on peer-to-peer games like COD or Destiny are nothing they can fix in the month they have
                    in between games, and if the game is REALLY bad (rainbow six i’m looking at you) they you have the promise
                    they will fix it by the time the game comes out. Stress test are just a way of saying “oh yeah we are
                    testing the game but pretty much what you see is what you will get” </p>

                <h2> Legit betas </h2>
                <p> The last problem I wanna talk about is the games that have legit beta tests. Smite had a lot of problems
                    with lag and connection issues when it came out, but after a few months, when the game came out it was
                    a solid build of the game. Why am I saying this? Well because I recently saw a post on reddit complaining
                    that the glitchy Halo Wars 2 beta test is too buggy and the game would be dead before it even launched,
                    eight months before the release. Betas are suppose to be glitchy and buggy yes, but it is not an excuse
                    for the core game to be bad, and players that are used to play betas that are pretty stable (battlefront
                    and destiny were basically the whole game) judge the final game based on what they saw. These gamers
                    are the ones that kill game betas and give the developers a bad reputation because they expect the betas
                    to be the final game just because some other developers use the term as an excuse to sell you the game.
