                    <h3>Attention</h3>
                    <p>
			These reviews are based on the mindset of three different gamers, which you may or may not agree with depending on what we have to say (and that's completely fine).
			This group is composed of three different types of gamers that do not honestly relate to each other in anyway			<br>
			<br>
			We have the tryhard gamer that enjoys games based on the online environment and how well the game performs on a competitive level. Needless to say he bases his opinions and his reviews on the main aspect of how a games multiplayer handles and how well it contributes to a competitive environment.<br>
			<br>
			We also have a vivid gamer that expects games to to always be better(and understandably so) than the rest of the series, expecting a game to keep up with the other games released in the same franchise at the same time and as previewing games in the same genre in order to compare and contrast them to the best of his abilities.<br>
			<br>
			We also have a casual gamer that judges a game on how much fun he gets out of it while playing with friends. He expects the game to be about the experience he obtains while playing and enjoying himself rather than winning or losing. Another aspect he takes into account while judging a game is the complexity level it has towards newcomers.<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			Also we are not professional reviewers and so we don't expect our views to be everyone's views. We do this for the fun and the experience we get out of informing other players of the real face of gaming, while at the same time enjoying debating about or even arguing about our opinion on certain games. At the end of the day we are just your regular everyday players. Thank you for reading. ðŸ’œ
