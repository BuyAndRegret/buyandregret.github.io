                            <p>Well to say the least it's Doom the old hit with a new look and fun gameplay. Doom is good mix of both worlds, a fun filled campaign with an action packed and great multiplayer. I enjoy Doom as a whole even though I am actually pretty bad at the game. I think it's a great time to time game unless you're a die hard Doom fan than go all out with it. It's a game worth the praise it gets and I haven't said that about a game in a while.<br>

                            <p>Dark Souls the glorious and super easy(it's a joke) single or coop rpg game that took players by storm. I am not a very campaign heavy gamer nor have I ever been since I look for competitive multiplayer to suit my needs. I will say though Dark Souls is a whole different beast all together and I enjoy it very much so. After playing the games technical prologue and getting decimated again and again I never felt like quiting since the gameplay is addicting. Dark Souls brings the want of a very strong and "competitive" campaign game to life for me and I couldn't be happier. It's a great game and fantastic to play by yourself or with your buddies just please I don't need invaders in my game it's hard enough.<br>

                            <p>Smite is a Moba otherwise known as a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena. These genre of games have had incredible success from Dota 2 to League of Legends, Smite on the other hand may not be as successful as the others but has a ton of potential and promise and that is why it is my favorite above the rest. It brings in a thrid person perspective instead of the normal top down view most mobas have which I have never been a fan of. Smite is a lot of fun so much so I am able to play it for hours on end. Yet for being so fun it is very competitive no matter the gamemode you play and fills my need for competition. Smite like many other games is insanely skill and thought based which are qualities I look for in games I play. All in all Smite is a very well rounded game and definitely will be consuming my time for years to come and hopefully yours too. I'll see you on the Battleground my "friends".<br>

                        <p>This game is one of my (ItsHaysus) favorite because the online part of the game is fun relative to the crazyness of your friends. This game will never cease to entretain me as long as i play with people i know<br>

		<p>The game won me with the april's fool prank about the butt pose. The game itself is casual at the moment and it DOES NOT justify the 60 dollar price tag. The game is fun but i'd wait for a price cut<br>

                <p>Game of the year material. I've put over 100 hours in this game(without dlc, because dlc is for tools) and i dont see an end to this game. Highly recommend buying it. <br>
